<p>Red means that the the slope of the graph above is greater than 25 and the cases per population is high.</p>
<p>Yellow means that the slope of the graph above is between 0 and and 50 and the cases per population is moderate.</p>
<p>Green means that the slope of the graph above is less than 0 (negative) or the cases per population is low.</p> <br>
<p>Linear Regression is used to find the slope and thus predict the trend by</p> 
<p>averaging all the points (line of best fit). Pay attention to the axes. </p> 
<p>The y-axis is different from other COVID maps you will find.</p><br>
