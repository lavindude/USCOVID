<p>Red means that the the slope of the graph above is greater than 50.</p>
<p>Yellow means that the the slope of the graph above is between 0 and 50.</p>
<p>Green means that the the slope of the graph above is below 0.</p> <br>
<p>Linear Regression is used to find the slope and thus predict the trend by</p> 
<p>averaging all the points (line of best fit). Pay attention to the axes. </p> 
<p>The y-axis is different from other COVID maps you will find.</p><br>
